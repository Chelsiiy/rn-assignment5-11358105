This is my 5th project and over here , I used react JS , Javascript , Snack-expo and visual studio code.
I made an application where there the home and settings screen appear at the bottom of the application.
I made use of custom components and made a functional app.
I also made a feature that will enable the user toggle between light and dark mode.
